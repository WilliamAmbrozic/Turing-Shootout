# Turing-Shootout
This is a simple game I developed when I was 14 in 2015. As you can probably tell, the game is an emulation of a shootout in a game of Soccer/Football. The game was written in the Turing programming language. 
## The Turing Programming Language
>"Turing is a Pascal-like programming language developed in 1982 by Ric Holt and James Cordy, then of University of Toronto, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Turing is a descendant of Euclid, Pascal and SP/k that features a clean syntax and precise machine-independent semantics" (Wikipedia 2018).
