# Turing-Shootout
This is a game I developed when I was 14 in 2015. The game was written in the Turing programming language. 
## Turing
Turing is a Pascal-like programming language developed in 1982 by Ric Holt and James Cordy, then of University of Toronto, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Turing is a descendant of Euclid, Pascal and SP/k that features a clean syntax and precise machine-independent semantics (Wikipedia).
